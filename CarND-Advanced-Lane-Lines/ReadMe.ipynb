    "### Writeup / README\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Provide a Writeup / README that includes all the rubric points and how you addressed each one.  You can submit your writeup as markdown or pdf.  [Here](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Advanced-Lane-Lines/blob/master/writeup_template.md) is a template writeup for this project you can use as a guide and a starting point.  \n",

    "### Camera Calibration\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Briefly state how you computed the camera matrix and distortion coefficients. Provide an example of a distortion corrected calibration image.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code for this step is contained in the first two code cells of the IPython notebook located in \"./lanes.ipynb\".  \n",
    "\n",
    "I start by preparing \"object points\", which will be the (x, y, z) coordinates of the chessboard corners in the world. Here I am assuming the chessboard is fixed on the (x, y) plane at z=0, such that the object points are the same for each calibration image.  Thus, `objp` is just a replicated array of coordinates, and `objpoints` will be appended with a copy of it every time I successfully detect all chessboard corners in a test image.  `imgpoints` will be appended with the (x, y) pixel position of each of the corners in the image plane with each successful chessboard detection.  \n",
    "\n",
    "I then used the output `objpoints` and `imgpoints` to compute the camera calibration and distortion coefficients using the `cv2.calibrateCamera()` function.  I applied this distortion correction to the test image using the `cv2.undistort()` function and obtained this result: \n",

    "\n",
    "### Pipeline (single images)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Provide an example of a distortion-corrected image.\n",
    "To demonstrate this step, I will describe how I apply the distortion correction to one of the test images like this one:\n",
    "![alt text][image2]\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you performed a perspective transform and provide an example of a transformed image.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The code for my perspective transform includes a function called `perspective_transform()`, which appears in \"./Notebook.ipynb\".  The `perspective_transform()` function takes as inputs an image (`image`), as well as source (`src`) and destination (`dst`) points.  I chose the hardcode the source and destination points in the following manner:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "src = np.float32([\n",
    "  [(width/2) - size_top, height*0.65],\n",
    "  [(width/2) + size_top, height*0.65],\n",
    "  [(width/2) + size_bottom, height-50],\n",
    "  [(width/2) - size_bottom, height-50]\n",
    "])\n",
    "dst = np.float32([\n",
    "  [(width/2) - output_size, (height/2) - output_size],\n",
    "  [(width/2) + output_size, (height/2) - output_size],\n",
    "  [(width/2) + output_size, (height/2) + output_size],\n",
    "  [(width/2) - output_size, (height/2) + output_size]\n",
    "])\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "This resulted in the following source and destination points:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Source        | Destination   |\n",
    "|:-------------:|:-------------:|\n",
    "| 570, 468      | 280, 0        |\n",
    "| 710, 468      | 1000, 0       |\n",
    "| 1010, 670     | 1000, 720     |\n",
    "| 270, 670      | 280, 720      |\n",
    "\n",
    "I verified that my perspective transform was working as expected by drawing the `src` and `dst` points onto a test image and its warped counterpart to verify that the lines appear parallel in the warped image.\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text][image3]\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you used color transforms, gradients or other methods to create a thresholded binary image.  Provide an example of a binary image result.\n",
    "I used a combination of color and gradient thresholds to generate a binary image (thresholding steps at lines # through # in `another_file.py`).  Here's an example of my output for this step.  (note: this is not actually from one of the test images)\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text][image4]\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you identified lane-line pixels and fit their positions with a polynomial?\n",
    "\n",
    "First check the histogram of the lower part of image and find two peaks for the left and right lane lines. Then use the sliding window method upwards and find the points in the image which mark the lane. Next, use the `np.polyfit()` method to fit a second degree polynomial to these points. I did this in the `fit_polynomials()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text][image5]\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you calculated the radius of curvature of the lane and the position of the vehicle with respect to center.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the detected points, determine a second degree polynomial that fits these points, and calculate the radius of curvature of the polynomial. Apply the formula to compute real measurements in meters. This is done in `get_curvature()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. Provide an example image of your result plotted back down onto the road such that the lane area is identified clearly.\n",
    "\n",
    "I implemented this step in the function `process_image()`.  Here is an example of my result on a test image:\n",

    "\n",
    "### Pipeline (video)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Provide a link to your final video output.  Your pipeline should perform reasonably well on the entire project video (wobbly lines are ok but no catastrophic failures that would cause the car to drive off the road!).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a [link to my video result](./project_video_out.mp4)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Briefly discuss any problems / issues you faced in your implementation of this project.  Where will your pipeline likely fail?  What could you do to make it more robust?\n",
    "\n",
    "The major challenge is in deciding the thresholds for the gradients. It is very difficult to choose optimal set of parameters to satisfy all scenarios. This algorithm will only work if both the left and right lane lines are visible. If one of them is not visible, then the algorithm fails. Also, temporal information is not considered in our approach. Temporal data would help detect the lanes better. \n",
    "Also, the left and right lanes should ideally be parallel. This check can also be used to determine lanes if one of the lanes is not clearly visible. \n",
